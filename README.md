# Morpheus by Kreatyve Designs
Morpheus is an open-source application written in C and C++ for sharing and downloading ebooks officially from Kreatyve Designs.

## Our Goals
Our goal for this project is to deliver a robust and open-source F2F platform for sharing and downloading ebooks within our community.

## Database Goals
Our database goals include creating a library capable of working with JSON and XML to efficiently manage ebook metadata and content.

## Parser and Reader
We provide a parser and reader for processing the data within the ebook files. This library, located inside the 'data-dir' folder, allows users to manipulate data from the zip content folder.

## Web UI
Morpheus also comes with a web-based user interface, accessible via localhost, where users can manage their ebooks, view their library, and perform various actions conveniently.

## Contributions
Everyone is welcome to contribute to the project. Fork the repository and start contributing to make Morpheus even better.
